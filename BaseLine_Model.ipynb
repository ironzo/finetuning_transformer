    "It's a hot summer on Amity Island, a small community whose primary business is its beaches. When new Sheriff Martin Brody discovers the remains of a shark attack victim, his first inclination is to close the beaches to swimmers. It doesn't sit well with Mayor Larry Vaughn and several local business people. Brody backs down to his regret of that weekend. A predator kills a young boy. The dead boy's mother puts out a bounty on the shark, and Amity is soon swamped with amateur hunters and fishermen hoping to cash in on the reward. A local fisherman with much experience hunting sharks, Quint, offers to hunt down the creature for a hefty fee. Soon, Quint, Brody, and Matt Hooper from the Oceanographic Institute are hunting the Great White shark at sea. As Brody succinctly surmises after their first encounter with the creature, they will need a bigger boat.—garykmcd\n",

Darcy shows up to a dinner where she meets with her mother, Renata (Sonia Braga), who thinks the big wedding is too flashy. Meanwhile, Tom is setting up a surprise for Darcy on a motorboat but gets startled by the security guard, causing him to fall into the water.\n",

      "Tom's mother, Carol (Jennifer Coolidge), arrives with her second husband, Larry (Steve Coulter). At the same time, Darcy's father, Robert (Cheech Marin), shows up with his new younger girlfriend, Harriet (D'Arcy Carden), which annoys Renata since she still hates Robert after their divorce. While Darcy and Tom try to spend time together, Tom gets pulled away by his best friend/best man Ricky (Desmin Borges), leaving Darcy to be with her younger sister Jamie (Callie Hernandez). Complicating matters is the arrival of Darcy's charming ex-boyfriend Sean (Lenny Kravitz), who was invited by Robert. He calls Darcy \"Dee Dee,\" and his presence puts Tom on edge, with everyone seeing he is clearly jealous. Tom delivers a speech that is upstaged by Sean's more personal speech toward Darcy. This is followed by Tom's sister Jeannie (Melissa Hunter) delivering a speech discussing her recent marital problems.\n",

      "The next morning is wedding day. As preparations are being made, a group of pirates makes their way toward the island after seeing the couple's wedding website. Darcy is helped by Renata, Jamie, and Carol into her dress, but she feels that something isn't right. She texts Tom to meet privately, and Darcy says she feels that having everyone come to the Philippines for their wedding was too much, as she never wanted a big wedding. They argue until they decide that they ought to call off the wedding, just as the pirates storm the resort and take the staff and guests hostage. Tom witnesses this and runs to warn Darcy. The pirates force everyone into a pool and demand a $45 million ransom from Robert, as they know how wealthy he is.\n",

      "Tom gets Darcy out of her room and tells her what's happening. They see an armed pirate attempting to break in and try to come up with a plan to trap him. While they attempt to subdue him with their own ideas (Tom wants to trap him in a net while Darcy thinks spraying his eyes with hairspray would do the trick), they both get taken down and are tied up together. The pirates then head with the couple to bring them to their leader, but Darcy asks for a cigarette and uses it to light the pirates' heads on fire, causing them to jump out and leaving the couple to try and take control of the driver less cart. They manage to jump out, but Darcy's dress gets caught and is mostly ripped off as the cart falls over a cliff. They are then attacked by one of the pirates, but Darcy manages to pull a grenade from his hand, and Tom kicks him and makes him fall against a rock, killing him. This leaves him mortified at killing a man.\n",

      "Darcy and Tom try to find a way to untie themselves, but Tom informs Darcy to be careful with the grenade she is holding because it doesn't have a pin in it, and her dropping it could set it off. They try to find an area with good cell reception so they can call for help, but they get chased by more pirates, and Darcy drops the phone. They find a zip line tower where they descend, and Darcy drops the grenade on two pirates, which alerts the others to their location when it blows up. When the couple lands, they are scared to see their loved ones being held hostage and try to find a way to get help.\n",

While tending to Tom's wound, Margy lets it slip that the resort was hit by pirates the previous summer, which Tom had known about. Darcy yells at Tom over this and his habit of self-sabotaging and his insecurities, which is what led him to make the big wedding. Tom hits back that Darcy is putting on a big front of being confident when she is also scared. Tom then takes responsibility for the hostages since he brought them all there. When another pirate starts getting close, Ace and Margy send the couple down a tunnel, but Tom gets out and turns himself in to be captured, leaving Darcy hidden.\n",

Tom deduced that Sean is the bad guy who hired the pirates because Sean had said the phrase earlier, and Tom figured the pirates are Balinese. He even produces a wedding invitation that one of the pirates had, and Tom states that Sean had hoped to get the ransom from Robert since he did not give him investment money. Sean drops the act and breaks free, joining the pirates and holding a gun at Tom.\n",

Darcy arrives with a gun and tries to reconcile with Tom before taking on the pirates. The pirates end up taking Darcy with the other hostages, with one of the pirates personally wanting to kill Darcy because she burned his face. The others then learn that Harriet was in on the scheme the whole time, as Larry had been recording everything and got footage of her and Sean making out.

Harriet attempts to shoot at them from the helicopter. As Darcy speeds the boat up, Tom and Sean get caught in a para-sail that flies upwards. Tom uses a chunk of fake hair to zip line down, and Darcy uses a cake knife that Carol gave her to cut the para-sail loose, causing Sean to get shredded by the helicopter's blades, and Harriet goes down into the ocean when the helicopter crashes.\n",

After settling in, Jessica instructs John to purchase veal cutlets for dinner despite John preferring hamburgers. At the store in town, Anna takes an interest in yearold local Isaac, who flirts oddly with Anna.

He's drooling on a table and begins to eat a sad looking meal while on a certain drug (he's asked by a worker about his side effects he's having) he looks over at a drooling girl and she plays with her food for a moment and he vomits all over his plate. Next Simon is in an office upset about pay(we see now that he signed up for a drug clinical trial to make some money) and he doesn't get the full amount because he didn't complete all the days he's supposed to so he only gets paid partially. He leaves the office upset and curses out the doctor. He runs into the drooling girl from earlier outside and walks her home because it's Sunday and her bus is not coming. He eats dinner with her family and her mom seduces him in the kitchen and it causes a scene and Simon causes a big fire in their bushes, making him a wanted man by police. Next scene we meet our new character Patty who is often ridiculed and made fun of by jocks. Patty is very socially awkward and doesn't appear to have many friends. She sits on a bench while jocks bully her and steal her sandwich. Patty works at a pet store. Jocks and their girlfriends bully her and she goes home and plays basketball badly and she sees a dead cat on her lawn and watches it for a moment. Pattys family has dinner and she asks her mom and dad to go to a concert on the weekend and they say no cuz they are squares. She has an adopted brother named Kevin who doesn't know yet that he's adopted and they bicker at the table. She goes to her room and turns on her favorite punk band \"Psyops\"(John Q is the frontman and she's obsessed)dances around then takes a dirty photo of herself to send to John Q. Simon is shown at a bank and fights with the lady at the counter to cash a check. He takes his cash to his drug dealers and buys a whole stash to sell. We see him next at the post office picking up mail from a PO Box and we see a black envelope addressed to \"John Q. Public\". We see him walk down the street after dealing some drugs as a cop drives by and recognizes him. He runs away in an alley and hides on a high up stairwell and sees patty and silently signals her not to tell the police he's there. She agrees and they talk for a few minutes and we find out he was in her music appreciation class in junior college before she drops out. He follows paddy back into her home lighting a cigarette and patty says no her dad is allergic but he smokes it anyways. He tells her he owes her one for helping him hide. Simon joins them at family dinner while lying that he's a missionary so they'll allow him to stay for the week to lay low from the cops because they wouldn't look for him there. Simon reveals to Kevin he was adopted to mess with him. Patty shows Simon her medications in her room. Patty says to Simon that she loves Psyops and wants to go to their show in a few days and they're opening for a band called \"the alliance\". Simon gets upset. It's revealed that \"John Q\" is Simon but paddy doesn't know yet. (No one knows who John q is because he wears a ski mask)Paddy tells him she writes love letters to John Q and Simon goes to the bathroom opens his backpack and the black envelopes are from Paddy. He jumps out the window and goes to his band mates yelling upset that they would book a show with The Alliance as Simon says they're \"eyeliner punk for 14 year old girls\". 2 band mates want to play the show but Simon and one other do not. One of the band mates reveals to Simon that their promoter will be very upset if they don't play the show with the alliance and that they were asked by police about Simon and said that the reward for turning him in increased to five thousand dollars. Simon leaves his band mates and sneaks back into patty's house. Kevin jumps on him they fight for a moment and Simon makes peace by getting him stoned and they become friends. The next morning Patty is looking through the paper for a new job because she was let go from the pet store.

The group then finds out valuable clues about Dick Dastardly's plan and they all find out that his plan is to open the gates to the Underworld in order to rescue his dog, Muttley, who was trapped during an attempt to steal the Underworld's riches, and Dastardly needs ScoobyDoo because only he can unlock the gates.ScoobyDoo, Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee arrive at Messick Mountain and head underground to a hidden, mysterious Mesozoic island. There, they find the last skull being guarded by Captain Caveman. Following a short battle, Fred and Shaggy arrive, but Fred is revealed to be Dastardly, in disguise, and he steals the last skull. The Rottens then throw the real Fred, Daphne, and Velma out of his airship and Dastardly destroys the Falcon Fury. Dastardly then captures Scooby and takes him to Athens along with the last skull. Fred and Blue Falcon argue while Velma, Daphne, Dee Dee, and Dynomutt try to break them up, but Shaggy stops their argument and takes the blame for Scooby's capture after letting his jealousy strain their friendship. After Shaggy gives an inspiring speech, everyone works together to reconstruct the Mystery Machine in order to pursue Dastardly.Arriving in Athens, Dastardly uses the three skulls to reveal the gates to the Underworld and attempts to use Scooby's paw to open it, only to be interrupted by Scooby's friends in a flying Mystery Machine. The Rottens shoot them down while Dastardly releases Cerberus; unaware that Dynomutt landed them safely. As Scooby, Dastardly, and the civilians flee from the rampaging Cerberus, Scooby runs to the crash site and reunites with his friends, while Dastardly reunites with Muttley in the Underworld and they escape after stealing some of Alexander the Great's treasure. While Scooby, Shaggy, Dynomutt, Blue Falcon, and Dee all determine how to trap Cerberus, Velma, Fred, and Daphne all discover more of the mystery behind Scooby's ancestry and its connection to the Underworld. With help from the Rottens, Mystery Inc. and friends trap Cerberus and put him back in the Underworld. However, Shaggy sacrifices himself to lock the gate. The gang realizes that there is another exit, which Scooby unlocks, and Shaggy is reunited with them.The Rottens turn on Dick Dastardly and Muttley, and Shaggy unmasks Dastardly who is revealed to be Simon Cowell, in disguise. Upon realizing that the real Simon Cowell was actually busy judging a talent show and thus being impossible for one to simultaneously find time judging one while even building an airship, Velma unmasks Cowell who is revealed to be Dastardly, in disguise, the whole time, trying to demoralize the gang and break the team up for his mysteriously villainous plan plotted against Mystery Inc., since the start. Dick Dastardly and Muttley are both taken into custody by Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee, and are arrested.Back home at Venice Beach, Scooby and the gang unveil their new Mystery Inc. headquarters and celebrates with Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee, who in turn give them an upgraded Mystery Machine before they head off to solve another regular mystery together again.During the credits, the Mystery Gang's popularity rises and they are seen consulting Dr. Benton Quest after leaving the Rottens in his care, Blue Falcon and Dynomutt form the Falcon Force with new members Captain Caveman, Jabberjaw, Atom Ant, and Grape Ape while Muttley breaks Dastardly out of prison.\n",

      "Text: The film follows the Turtle brothers as they work to earn the love of New York City while facing down an army of mutants. After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. But they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them. Fifteen years ago, a Techno Cosmic Research Institute strike force is ordered by executive Cynthia Utrom to capture rogue scientist Baxter Stockman, who stole company secrets and technology, and any research. Desiring a family, Stockman creates a mutagen to create his own mutant family, starting with a housefly maggot. Before he can create more mutagen, the strike force arrives. While it is dealt with by the fly mutant, an explosion in the fight destroys the lab and most of the research while killing Stockman. Additional TCRI forces arrive and collect the remainder of the surviving research, but forget the mutant and the last canister of mutagen, the latter of which falls into the sewers below.In the present, in New York City, four turtles (Michaelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello) have been raised by their adoptive father Splinter. While they are adept in the arts of ninjitsu, they are instructed to only leave for the surface world to get supplies for their home in the sewers.During these runs, they occasionally go and see attractions like outdoor movies, concerts, and sports, which makes them want to be on the surface more. When Splinter discovers what they have been doing, he punishes them, explaining their backstory: the mutagen from Stockman's house fell on the four baby turtles, who were found by Splinter (then a rat that was cynical and untrusting of the surface world, specifically of humans). While handling the turtles, Splinter also comes into contact with the mutagen, mutating all of them to have more human-like features. As the Turtles grew older and became more curious about the surface, he decided to take them to the surface where they are all nearly killed. This leads Splinter and the Turtles to all learn martial arts for their protection.Sometime later during one of their supply runs, the Turtles accidentally get the attention of a teenage girl named April. While yelling at the turtles but not seeing them, she gets her moped stolen. The Turtles are able to get it back after defeating the group that stole it and reveal themselves to her. April shows the turtles to her high school where the group discusses their goals: the turtles want to be embraced by the surface world, while April is an aspiring journalist, who wants to move past an embarrassing viral incident where she vomited from anxiety during her school announcements. They decide to help each other out; April has been investigating a series of violent robberies on TCRI technology by a criminal named Superfly, which have led parents to call for a city-wide curfew that would cancel the school's Prom. If she records and writes an article on who Superfly is and how the Turtles would stop him, April and the Turtles would be regarded as heroes and accepted. Meanwhile, TCRI has been following the reports of the Superfly robberies. Cynthia decides to place trackers on any technology to find him.Using leads from April, the Turtles find out that Superfly is collecting a piece of technology that night in a deal under the Brooklyn Bridge. They are able to find the part and pose as the buyers, and discover that not only is Superfly a fly mutant, but also has a gang of mutants with him like Leatherhead, Mondo Gecko, Genghis Frog, Wingnut, Scumbug, Ray Fillet, and Bebop and Rocksteady. Ecstatic that there are other mutants, Superfly invites the Turtles to go on a night in the town with him and his gang, where they bond. He explains his story and plan: like the Turtles, the mutagen evolved him and the rest of his mutant gang, and he took on the role of their father figure. When he brought them to the surface, they too were nearly killed by humans, but they escaped. In their escape, Superfly nearly killed a human. Deciding that humans are all evil and would never accept them, he would create a weapon that would turn the ooze into an airborne virus, which would mutate all non-human wildlife on the planet, and make them the dominant species while enslaving humanity in the process. The Turtles try to stop them by trying to escape with the last part, but Superfly and his gang escape with it, and the Turtles are left to be captured by TCRI, who had a tracker on the part. Having followed the Turtles from a distance, April leaves to get Splinter to rescue them.At TCRI headquarters, the Turtles are slowly \"milked\" of their mutagen, before they are rescued by Splinter and April. Betrayed by his sons' lies and despite stating that April is the only good human, Splinter decides that they will stop Superfly before they stay in the sewers permanently. When they reach the island, Leonardo and Splinter plead to the conscious of Superfly's gang, stating that if they enslave humanity then they are no better than the humans themselves. The gang agrees and everyone fights Superfly, destroying the machine in the process.Unfortunately, the ooze enlarges and combines Superfly with other local wildlife into a bipedal whale-like creature who dubs himself \"SuperDuperFly\", deciding to attack New York City. The Turtles, Splinter, the Mutants, and April head to mainland New York City to stop him once and for all. While the Turtles, Splinter, and the Mutants fight, April is able to overcome her anxiety and explain on live air to the public what is going on, leading the citizens of New York to help stop SuperDuperFly. Donatello discovers that the blowhole on the back of his neck carries a massive amount of mutagen, and the Turtles are able to drop a canister of anti-ooze into SuperDuperFly's blowhole, returning him to being a regular fly.The Turtles, Splinter, April, and the Mutants are recognized as heroes by the city, and the boys reconcile with their father, who apologizes for his xenophobic behavior. Soon after, the Mutants move into the sewers with the Turtles and Splinter, and the Turtles enroll at April's high school, where they are all embraced as heroes.In a mid-credit scene, the Turtles are shown enjoying high school life: Michaelangelo is participating in the school's comedy improv team, Raphael has joined the wrestling team, Donatello has found the computer club, and Leonardo (who, throughout the film, has developed a crush on April) has decided to help her with her journalistic interests, now focused on TCRI who have mysteriously disappeared since the events of the film. While the five are later enjoying themselves at the school prom, Cynthia, who is spying on them (and with the now unmutated Superfly by her side) decides that the focus is to capture the Turtles by bringing in Shredder.\n",

Then, as the stone-faced police officers, Chief Cliff Robertson and Officer Ronnie Peterson, stop for doughnuts and coffee at the town's diner, unusual activity in the moon-lit cemetery and a blood-soaked scene of carnage could only mean one thing: this is the work of flesh-eating zombies. Before long, Officer Mindy Morrison and the glacially beautiful, katana-wielding undertaker, Zelda Winston, join the team of defenders, as hordes of relentless, ravenous undead swarm into the once-peaceful town craving meat. More and more, humans are at risk of becoming an endangered species. What happens when the dead just don't want to die? In a small town called Centreville two police officers - Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray), and Officer Ronnie Petersen (Adam Driver) - are responding to a call about a stolen chicken. Farmer Frank Miller (Steve Buscemi) reported the missing chicken and his belief that Hermit Bob (Tom Waits) is the thief. Officers Cliff and Ronnie confront Hermit Bob in the forest he lives in. Bob shoots a warning shot at the officers to leave him be. Ronnie asks Cliff if they should take him in, but Cliff says no and the two leave. In the patrol car, Cliff tells Ronnie that he has known Hermit Bob since they were young and Bob has never done anything to harm anyone. He also states he thinks it's unlikely that Bob was the one to take the chicken. The two discuss how the sun is still bright in the sky despite it being after eight at night.

Officer Ronnie turns on the regular radio in the car to the song 'The Dead Don't Die' by Sturgill Simpson. When Cliff asks Ronnie why he loves the song so much, he replies that it's because it's the theme song of the movie - the first of many fourth-wall breaks in the movie.\n",

      "Text: A young boy and his grandmother have a run-in with a coven of witches and their leader.Reimagining Roald Dahl's beloved story for a modern audience, Robert Zemeckis's visually innovative film tells the darkly humorous and heartwarming tale of a young orphaned boy who, in late 1967, goes to live with his loving Grandma in the rural Alabama town of Demopolis. As the boy and his grandmother encounter some deceptively glamorous but thoroughly diabolical witches, she wisely whisks him away to a seaside resort. Regrettably, they arrive at precisely the same time that the world's Grand High Witch has gathered her fellow cronies from around the globe-undercover-to carry out her nefarious plans. Zemeckis is joined by a world-class team of filmmakers, including Alfonso CuarÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â³n, Guillermo del Toro and Kenya Barris. The cast includes powerhouse performances from Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci, Kristin Chenoweth and Chris Rock, with newcomer Jahzir Kadeen Bruno as the brave young hero. It may come as a surprise; but, witches are real. They live among us, disguised as ordinary humans, and they feed off fear. Now, whether he likes it or not, an innocent orphaned boy is about to discover the shocking truth behind the demonic creatures, shortly after relocating to late 1960 Demopolis, Alabama, to live with his kind grandmother. And before long, a hair-raising encounter with the supernatural jolts grandma into action, forcing her to take her boy to a luxurious seaside hotel far away from home to protect him. Unfortunately, the otherwise impeccable resort is rife with danger, as a secret coven of fashionable witches is holding its annual conference in plain sight. It seems that their mighty leader, the scheming Grand High Witch of All the World, has hatched a plan, and no one is safe--especially children. Can they escape from their clutches? Will they give the evil witches a dose of their own medicine? In 1968 Alabama, a young boy goes to live with his grandmother following the death of his parents in Chicago. Slowly, the boy gets cheered up with his grandmother, buying him a pet mouse whom he names Daisy. One day, Charlie goes to buy a box of nails to train Daisy and to build a house for her as well. The boy is approached by a witch trying to lure him with a snake and a caramel, but the grandmother calls him and the witch disappears.After telling the grandmother about the encounter, the boy learns that the witches are in fact real. She says a witch cursed her best friend Alice into spending the rest of her life as a chicken. The grandmother says that witches never leave once they find a child. Frantically, they decide to stay in a nearby hotel where her cousin Eston is the executive chef. While there, grandmother tells, the boy how to tell a witch from an ordinary woman: real witches have claws instead of fingernails which they hide by wearing gloves, are bald which they hide by wearing wigs that give them rashes, have square feet with no toes which they hide by wearing sensible shoes, have a purple tinge in their pupils and have a powerful sense of smell which they use to sniff out children.The next day, the boy takes Daisy and a rope to go get some training done at a grand hall. As he walks there, he meets a gluttonous but friendly boy named Bruno, who gets pulled away by his mother. He then goes into the grand hall, thinking that he will be alone. As he's getting ready to train Daisy, a group of witches led by their all-powerful leader, the Grand High Witch, go into the grand hall; the boy hides under the stage and discovers that the Grand High Witch is planning to give the world's children a potion, which will be used in confectionery products that can transform the children into mice. The Grand High Witch waits for Bruno to arrive, for whom she gave a chocolate bar previously laced with the potion. After Bruno arrives, he turns into a mouse and enters the vent where the boy and Daisy are hiding. The Grand High Witch forcibly transforms the boy into a mice before they escape.Fleeing to the hotel room where the boy and his grandmother are staying, they tell the grandmother of the witches' plan and discover that the Grand High Witch is staying in the hotel room below them and that Daisy was once an orphaned young human girl named Mary turned into a mouse by a witch. He, Bruno, and Mary devise a plan to get a bottle of the potion so that the grandmother can devise a cure to turn them back into children. The plan is successful, but since, she is unable to create a cure, they instead decide to put the potion into a broth of pea soup which will be given to the witches during their dinner. All the witches except the Grand High Witch, who realizes that she had met the grandmother before as she was the witch that turned Alice into a chicken, drink the soup. While the mice steal the Grand High Witch's room key, the witches all begin turning into rats and chaos ensues.After she and the mice flee to the Grand High Witch's room, the grandmother starts to collect all the potions to destroy them. The Grand High Witch finds the grandmother, and prepares to kill her but the mice intervene and trick the Grand High Witch into swallowing her own potion, transforming her into a rat. They trap her in an ice bucket and prevent her from escaping. Before they leave the room, the grandmother takes the Grand High Witch's trunk full of money and releases her cat Hades from its cage. As they close the door, Hades attacks and kills her. After Bruno's parents do not accept him, he joins Mary, the boy, and the grandmother to go home with the Grand High Witch's trunk and become a family. Years later, older boy and his grandmother advise young children against the witches.\n",

Two years after the events of the first film, Cole is now a junior in high school. He is unable to convince anyone except for his best friend Melanie that a satanic cult led by his former babysitter Bee really tried to kill him. However, Cole finds out his parents have applied him in a psychiatric school, and he escapes with Melanie alongside her new boyfriend Jimmy, and their friends BoomBoom and Diego to join a lake party. At the party, Cole witnesses new student Phoebe, who has arrived at the lake after finding her missing childhood stuffed toy and directions to the lake in her locker. Later, Cole's friends play a party game on a boat when Melanie suddenly kills BoomBoom. She then reveals to Cole that she believed him because she had joined the cult to achieve her dreams of becoming a famous influence, with Jimmy and Diego also revealed as cult members. With BoomBoom's blood as a sacrifice, they need his blood again as an offering of an innocent to make their wishes come true. Original cultists Sonya, Allison, Max, and John also appear, having been resurrected so they could partake in the ritual or else they would die by sunrise. However, Phoebe suddenly appears, looking for gas for her jet ski, and provides Cole with some time to evade the cult members and escape with Phoebe on her jet ski. Once on land, Cole explains everything to Phoebe, who believes him, while the cultists give chase. Sonya is first to attempt to kill them, but they end up running her over with a car left by a stranger and is then decapitated with a surfboard after it flies off the car. Allison finds them, but the two trap her between a narrow wedge of rocks and then they proceed to rip her head off. The two board a boat and drive off, but Max catches the raft attached to the back of the boat and is able to pull himself onto the boat. However, Phoebe sets him on fire with a can of silly string and a lighter and Cole mutilates him with the boats propeller blades. Diego and Jimmy supernaturally disintegrate when they attempt to back off from their pursuit of Cole. Cole and Phoebe arrive at Phoebe's old family cabin, where they take refuge and hope to wait out the night, having been brought there from the mysterious message Phoebe received. In the cabin bunker, Phoebe reveals to Cole that her parents died because she crashed into them in a fatal car accident. Cole comforts her and admires her strength, and the two have sex. Melanie calls Cole's dad Archie, who has been frantically searching for him alongside Melanie's father Juan, and fakes being drunk so that he can pick them up, hoping to lure Cole out. Cole and Phoebe come out of the bunker armed with crossbows and John accidentally kills himself when a chandelier crashes on him. Cole and Phoebe flee and, after Archie follows after them, Melanie kills her father. Cole tells Phoebe to run away while he faces his father, who drugs him so he can take him home. Melanie and Phoebe face off in a fight, which ends with Melanie capturing Phoebe at knifepoint so she can serve as bait. While stopping for gas, Cole regains consciousness, locks Archie out of the car, and drives back to the lake to save Phoebe. In a cove, Melanie holds Phoebe hostage before Cole shows up and volunteers to be sacrificed. Suddenly, Bee emerges out of the water and is revealed to be Phoebe's babysitter who was responsible for the car accident that killed her parents. It is then revealed in flashbacks that Bee made a deal with the devil so she could save Phoebe's life. Sonya, Allison, Max, and John are resurrected again, and the four alongside Melanie drink the blood of Cole mixed with BoomBoom's blood. However, since Cole has had sex with Phoebe thereby losing his innocence, the ritual backfires and the five melt and disintegrate. Bee, who did not drink the blood, reveals that she orchestrated everything so that Phoebe and Cole could unite and defeat the cult, having had a change of heart after Cole's love confession after her initial defeat. However, since Bee is still technically a demon, she drinks the blood and disintegrates to save the two. Archie shows up and, having witnessed Bee's death, now believes what Cole said was true. As the sun comes up, Cole and Phoebe embrace in a kiss. In a midcredits scene, Bee's demon book is shown on the sand, still intact.\n",

      "Text: As a little girl, Roxana (Camille Rowe) used to go to the beach with her grandfather, who taught her to dive. The peace and tranquility that she experienced underwater were incomparable to worldly pleasures. She studied to be a marine biologist at college. One day, she noticed a poster of the world-famous free-diver, Pascal Gautier (Sofiane Zermani), who would be giving diving lessons to those interested. Without giving it a second thought, Roxana paid the course fee and reached the location on time. She met Tom (CÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©sar Domboy) there, a diving instructor who worked with Pascal. The two shared unmissable chemistry on the first day of class, but the moment Roxana had set her eyes on Pascal, she knew whom she wanted. There are 3 golden rules: 1. Always dive with a partner. 2. Dont try to dive as deep as possible 3. stay calmed and relaxed. Pascal had an incredible pain tolerance capacity, which was why he could endure the pressure and dive deep into the water. His calmness and capability impressed Roxana, and she could not take her eyes off him during the dinner party after the practice session. Pascal was a womanizer. Even with his girlfriend by his side, he continued to flirt with Roxana. They passionately made out in the washroom, and upon returning, his girlfriend broke up with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pascal taught Roxana the techniques to stay under water. Their shared passion for diving brought them closer to each other. Roxana felt at peace in Pascal's presence, and she would not trade it for the world. She soon joined Pascal's team in a practice session. On the first day itself, she understood how risky the profession was. While Pascal was aiming to set a world record by diving 172 meters underwater, his team was spread across several levels (at every 40 ms, with oxygen tanks) to monitor him. The dive is set up with a sled that takes Pascal very deep and whenever he is ready to come back up, he activates an gas cylinder which provides the thrust to quickly shoot him back up to the surface. Only submarines have gone below 172 meters ever. at that depth, the lungs are the size of an orange and a person cannot be given oxygen as their lungs would explode. Even though Pascal managed to complete the dive safely, one of his team members lost his life. Stephane (Laurent Fernandez), a team member, blamed Pascal for sending the rookie 40 meters down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team needed a new member, and Roxana stepped in to fill the position. Stephane was against it, knowing how risky it could be for her, but Pascal trusted Roxana's capability. He believed she was a natural and could adapt easily. Roxana learned the safety protocol and was prepared to assist Pascal. On the day of the event, Pascal successfully dived 172 m, and the team celebrated the new world record. Roxana was on top of the world. She had never felt so alive. She informed her mother that she would leave her studies to accompany Pascal on his journey. Her mother was not supportive of her decision, but she refused to listen to her advice. A few days after setting a new world record, another free-diver managed to go 174m down. Pascal had to compete now, and he was aiming for 176m. But this time, luck was not on his side. He suffered from a blackout, and the doctor advised him to stop diving. Pascal was not ready to give up, and Roxana could not change his mind, knowing how passionate he was about his profession. As he took a break, he introduced Roxana to the world of free-diving. She soon set a new record for French women by going 56m deep in the CWF (constant weight with fins) category. She was celebrated by the media for her achievement, and Pascal watched her from a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pascal could not accept defeat when a US woman Naomi (Natalie Mitson) created another new world record (beating the men's record of 174 m by diving till 178 m). He was determined to dive 180m and create a new record, but his team and the organizers knew that he was not fit enough to do so. As Roxana rose to fame (she consistently continued to shatter more world records and was celebrated as a sex symbol), Pascal could feel his importance fading away. Roxana looked up to him; he was her lover and her mentor, but he could not stand the celebration anymore. He was proud of Roxana but disappointed in himself. He went as far as to state that he would be happy to watch her set the new world record rather than allow any other person to do so. It was important for him to be involved either as a participant or as a coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roxana could sense the growing distance between her and Pascal. He would often leave her at night, and she would be left alone. Roxana's childhood was not easy. Her father committed suicide as a result of depression when she was 12. She always wondered why her father left her, and gradually she became obsessed with the idea of death. She attempted suicide, hoping to join her father, but her grandfather saved her life. We get a sense of how Roxana had been searching for the meaning of her existence, and it was only after meeting Pascal that she realized who she was meant to be. She emphasized how important Pascal was in her life and how the trophies and titles did not hold any value without him in her life. But he did not feel the same way. He was not ready to give up. For him, the competition mattered more than what he shared with Roxana. He decided Roxana would compete in the no-limit category even though his entire team thought it was a bad idea, but Roxana took up the challenge. She ends the argument by saying that she is doing the dive for herself. As she trained to prove Pascal right, he cheated on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pascal attempts the dive at 180 m and blacks out again. Roxana wants to quit, but Pascal wont let her. Roxana soon found out about his affair (when she follows Pascal one night and sees him kissing another girl), and she sought comfort in Tom. She tells TOm that her next dive (the record attempt) will be her last. She and Tom have sex. Roxana wants to leave Pascal, but he smashes his hand into a mirror and guilt her into staying. Roxana continues to train with Pascal. Pascal finds out that ROxana cheated on him with Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day of the competition, Roxana is thrown off by the appearance of the girl with whom Pascal cheated on her. Tom finds Pascal tinkering with the ballast tank, after he and Stephane did the final check on all the equipment. The dive starts and at the bottom, the ballast tank fails to open. Roxana is stuck. She runs out of air and her body gradually floats back up, where Stephane fishes her out of the water. Tom knows Pascal killed Roxana, but doesn't say anything to the police. The death is deemed accidental.\n",

Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film tracks the treacherous navigation of first love.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—United Artist Releasing', \"San Fernando Valley, 1973. Disarmed by his fearless confidence and surprising maturity, bored 25-year-old photographer's assistant Alana Kane reluctantly accepts to go out for a drink with sunny 15-year-old child actor Gary Valentine, her unexpected admirer. As one thing leads to another, the platonic soulmates embark on ambitious business ventures, trying to find their feet and purpose in a crazy world. But can Gary and Alana remain friends against the backdrop of life's ups and downs? California, early-1970s. Gary Valentine, a 15-year-old boy, is attracted to Alana Kane, the 20-something-year-old who appeared at his school to assist with taking school photos. He asks her out and after many such requests she reluctantly agrees. San Fernando Valley, 1973 - Several boys are getting ready to have their pictures taken, while a couple of others set off a cherry bomb in the bathroom. One of the boys, Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman), sees the photographer's assistant, Alana Kane (Alana Haim), and becomes smitten with her. He tries to talk to her, though she seems disinterested due to the fact that she is 25 and he is 15. Gary tells Alana that he is an actor, and he eventually succeeds in getting her to agree to hang out with him, but not as a date.Gary and Alana meet at a restaurant that he frequents since he appears to know the manager. The two discuss their jobs, and Gary mentions that he also works with his mother at a public relations company. Gary assures Alana that they are not going to forget each other. They walk home, and we see Alana lives with her parents and two sisters (all played by Haim's real family), while Gary lives with his brother Greg (Milo Herschlag).Gary works with his mom, Momma Anita (Mary Elizabeth Ellis), and they meet with a restaurant owner, Jerry Frick (John Michael Higgins), and his wife Mioko (Yumi Mizui), over a new Japanese restaurant they are trying to open. Jerry speaks with a accent racist accent to his wife. Later on, Anita tells Gary that she can't accompany him for a trip to New York where he will be featured on auditions and a variety show.Alana accompanies Gary to New York, where he rejoins his movie partners from the film \"Under One Roof\", where he starred as one of many siblings along with renowned actress Lucille Dolittle (Christine Ebersole). During the show, Gary hits Lucille over the head with a pillow, and when being interviewed, he makes a joke about \"doing three beavers\". Lucille later angrily chastises him and hits him. Afterward, Gary meets with an agent, Gale (Maya Rudolph), and does a commercial for a vest. While this happens, Alana befriends another actor named Lance (Skyler Gisondo).Upon returning to California, Alana begins a relationship with Lance. However, when she brings him over for dinner with her family, he declines to say a prayer because, despite being raised in the Jewish faith, he identifies as an atheist. Alana breaks things off with him shortly afterward.Gary soon gets into the waterbed business and gets his friends Kirk (Will Arangola) and Mark (Griff Giacchino), along with Alana, now that they are becoming friends, although Gary is still in love with her. They go to an expo called Soggy Bottom, where there are other booths like one for \"The Munsters\", with Fred Gwynne (John C. Reilly) in attendance. As Gary tries to sell the water beds, cops come to aggressively arrest him on suspicion of murder. Alana runs all the way to the police station, where Gary is soon let go when their first suspect says he doesn't know Gary. He leaves the station and hugs Alana.Alana operates the phones at the waterbed business, with Gary telling her to sound \"sexier\", but he feels she overdoes it. He later accompanies her to meet an agent, Mary Grady (Harriet Sansom Harris). When she asks Alana if she would do nudity in films, she initially says yes, but Gary urges her to say no. The two argue on the way home because Gary isn't comfortable with audiences seeing Alana nude when he can't. She later relents and shows him her breasts but slaps him when he asks to touch them.Alana joins Gary at an event to sell waterbeds, where Gary meets a girl from school named Sue Pomerantz (Isabelle Kusman). The two chat and go off to hook up, which Alana sees and appears jealous for it. She randomly kisses another guy out of spite and then walks home in nothing but her underwear (as she was modeling that way).Later on, Alana goes to an audition for a part alongside actor Jack Holden (Sean Penn). He takes a liking to her and compares her to Grace Kelly. Jack takes Alana to a bar, \"The Tail o' the Cock\", where Gary and his friends also make an appearance. Jack runs into his old friend, director Rex Blau (Tom Waits), and they convince everyone in attendance to watch Jack recreate a motorcycle stunt from his film \"The Bridges of Toko-San\", which he did with Kelly. Alana sits on the back of the motorcycle, but as soon as Jack takes off, Alana falls backwards. Gary runs all the way to Alana to make sure she is okay while everyone else cheers for Jack. He walks back with her to the waterbed store where she falls asleep. Gary contemplates groping her but decides against it.News reports come out that there is an oil embargo that is creating a gas crisis, which Alana says is in part thanks to the waterbeds, since they are made from vinyl, and vinyl is made from oil. The two, plus Greg, Kirk, and Mark, later deliver a waterbed to the home of producer Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper), who is something of a lunatic. He grills Gary for the pronunciation of his girlfriend's name (being Barbra Streisand), and explicitly threatens to kill Gary's whole family if he messes anything up during the setup. Gary and Alana set up the water bed, but accidentally pull the hose out and get the carpet wet. They get the other three boys out of there quickly.On their way out, they run into Jon coming up a hill, where he forces them to take him to the gas station to fill up since his car broke down. They leave him there when they see Jon threatening to light a man on fire by spraying him with the gas nozzle while holding a lighter. They drive back towards Jon's car, where Gary starts to smash the windshield. Unfortunately, their truck runs out of gas, and they have to roll the truck carefully down the hills backwards until it eventually stops in the middle of the street somewhere. Gary and the boys go off to get gas, while Alana sits on the street. Jon walks nearby and throws a garbage bin through a store window, but she manages to avoid being seen by him before he tries to hit on two tennis players.With the waterbed business failing from the gas crisis, Gary and Alana look to move onto other work. Gary invests in a pinball arcade while Alana decides to do volunteer work for mayoral candidate Councilman Joel Wachs (Benny Safdie). Gary and Alana have an argument, leading to them parting ways.While Alana is taking calls at the campaign office, she notices a creepy guy (Jon Beavers) scoping the office out. She confronts him but he gives her vague responses as to why he is there. Alana is later invited to drinks with Wachs, where the creepy guy is sitting nearby again. She meets Wachs' partner Matthew (Joseph Cross), and Alana learns that Wachs is gay and that the creep is most likely a spy trying to dig up dirt on Wachs and his campaign. Wachs asks Alana to go home with Matthew and pretend that she is his girlfriend. When they get home, Matthew breaks down in tears, asking Alana if she has a boyfriend. She says \"yes and no\", but they both cry over the fact that the guys in their life are jerks.Gary is at the opening of his pinball arcade, dealing with obnoxious kids and adults. He runs into Alana's friend and asks where she is. He runs to the campaign office to look for her but she is not there. Similarly, Alana goes to the restaurant where she first went out with Gary, but he isn't there. They eventually keep going until they literally run into each other in front of the movie theater. Gary brings Alana back to the arcade and introduces her as \"Mrs. Alana Valentine\". She calls him an idiot, but he then kisses her.The two run off again together, with Alana telling Gary that she loves him.\n",

After his wife's death, Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.) decided to hide from the world with his beloved animals. But he has to take a journey to a mysterious island to find a healing tree, which is the only medicine that can help the dying Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) in Buckingham Palace. After his wife's death, the eccentric, famed doctor and veterinarian of Victorian England, John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.) isolates himself away behind the high walls of Dolittle Manor with his animals for company. When Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) falls ill, a reluctant Dolittle is forced to go on an epic adventure to a mythical island in search of a cure, regaining his wit and courage as he crosses old adversaries and encounters wondrous creatures.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Santhosh. The film starts with a storybook-like depiction of the life of 19th Century British veterinarian Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.), as told by Poly the parrot (voice of Emma Thompson). He has the ability to communicate with animals, and he would travel the world with his beloved wife Lily (Kasia Smutniak), finding other scared or hurt animals and bringing them to their sanctuary. One day, Lily went sailing on a voyage with Poly, but she was caught in a terrible storm where she perished. Poly brought Dolittle her ring back, and he became so distraught that he closed up the sanctuary, shutting himself away from contact with other people.Years later, a boy named Tommy Stubbins (Harry Collett) is hunting with his uncle and cousin. He is too nervous to hit a bird, and he accidentally shoots a squirrel named Kevin (voice of Craig Robinson). Stubbins' uncle gives him a knife to put the squirrel out of his misery, but Stubbins instead takes it with him. Poly spots the boy and tells him to follow her, where she leads him to Dolittle's sanctuary. Stubbins is startled by Yoshi the polar bear (voice of John Cena), leading him to stumble into a trap. He is found by a girl called Lady Rose (Carmel Laniado), who was sent by Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) on an urgent matter.Inside the sanctuary, Dolittle is playing chess with several mice against Chee-Chee, (voice of Rami Malek) a cowardly gorilla, joined by Dab-Dab, (Octavia Spencer), a scatterbrained duck, and Jip, (voice of Tom Holland) a bespectacled dog. After learning that there are other humans outside, Dolittle sends Chee-Chee to answer the door. He and Stubbins freak each other out. Stubbins brings Kevin to Dolittle for help, while Lady Rose tells Dolittle that Queen Victoria has summoned him to Buckingham Palace. Dolittle helps Kevin recover but has no desire to leave his home. After much goading from Poly, Dolittle relents, tidies himself up, and heads out.Dolittle rides to Buckingham Palace using Plimpton (voice of Kumail Nanjiani), a neurotic ostrich, while Poly, Yoshi, Kevin, Jip, and Dab-Dab join. Upon arriving, he finds his former medical school rival, Dr. Blair Mudfly (Michael Sheen), there to check on the queen, brought up by Lord Badgley (Jim Broadbent). Dolittle and his animals enter the Queen's room, where he talks to her pet squid and learns that she was poisoned with deadly nightshade. The only cure is the Eden Fruit, which is on a far away island. Dolittle takes it upon himself to seek the tree out and bring back the fruit to save the Queen before an eclipse occurs, at which point she will perish. Although Stubbins wants to join Dolittle and be his apprentice after being amazed by the animals, Dolittle simply sends him back home.The next morning, Betsy the giraffe (voice of Selena Gomez) and Tutu the fox (voice of Marion Cotillard) join Poly in helping Stubbins escape his home and join Dolittle on his voyage. However, once they get to the docks, the ship has already departed. They spot a bridge, so Betsy rides with Stubbins until they manage to make it there and have him jump safely onto the ship.While on their journey, Stubbins takes time to learn the language of the other animals, which impresses Dolittle. Soon, Mudfly and his cronies sail nearby in their own ship and begin to catch up. Dolittle and Yoshi go underwater to get a whale to help pull them faster to the island. Dolittle's rope starts to break, so Stubbins tries to pull it back with Yoshi's help, but Chee-Chee freezes up when he has a chance to help pull. Dolittle does manage to get himself back onto the ship, but Chee-Chee is ashamed at himself for failing to help.Since their map doesn't have the exact location of the Eden Tree, the crew must stop at an island of bandits, run by King Rassouli (Antonio Banderas), who was also Lily's father. He is in possession of Lily's journal, which has the tree's location. Knowing that Rassouli would NOT be happy to see him, he and Stubbins attempt to disguise themselves. They are led by a dragonfly named James (voice of Jason Mantzoukas) to Rassouli's room where Stubbins tries to sneak in and find the journal while trying not to wake up Rassouli or his pet lionesses. The boy gets close, but Rassouli spots him and captures him, along with Dolittle.Rassouli throws Dolittle into a den where he must deal with a gold-fanged tiger named Barry (voice of Ralph Fiennes), who has serious mommy issues and has a bone to pick with Dolittle for not helping him get over this, while Stubbins is taken by the other bandits. Although Dolittle tries again, Barry is set on eating him. The other animals show up to help after Stubbins has James send them a message, with Yoshi blowing up the bandits' hideout, while Chee-Chee breaks into the cage and musters up the nerve to fight Barry. They help Dolittle get out as Stubbins has gotten the journal, but they are stopped by Mudfly and his soldiers, where the villain admits to having the Queen poisoned so that he can go find the cure and bask in all the rewards. They take the journal and destroy Dolittle's ship.As things are looking down, Yoshi and Plimpton bond over having negligent fathers. Dolittle expresses his disappointment in himself, which Rassouli overhears. Although he dislikes Dolittle for taking Lily away, he knows she would have wanted him to continue his quest. He gives him an old ship to allow him to return to the sea. Dolittle uses the help of whales to track down Mudfly's ship.The crew reaches the island but spot Mudfly's men already making their way inside. They climb up another way to get past the villains and eventually come across the tree and the fruit, but Mudfly and his men get there as well. Soon, they are confronted by a large dragon (Frances De La Tour), who begins to attack the soldiers. Dolittle saves Mudfly from getting killed, which leads to him having an epiphany about being a better person, only to push another soldier in the dragon's path before falling down a hole. After scaring away the other soldiers, the dragon sets her sights on Dolittle and his friends, but he then spots another dragon skeleton, which makes him realize she has lost her beloved, and so he sympathizes with her. He also notes that she is backed up internally, so he proceeds to give her an enema so that she may expel all the armor and weaponry that she has devoured over the years. She thanks Dolittle and allows him to take the fruit.With the Queen mere minutes from death, Dolittle and the animals manage to make it in time. However, Lord Badgley attempts to send the guards after them. The animals hold them off and get the fruit to Stubbins, who uses it to heal the Queen. Dolittle then learns from a stick bug that he left behind that Badgley is the mastermind behind the Queen's poisoning, as he has the vial of nightshade in his pocket. Badgley attempts to escape but is quickly subdued and imprisoned. The Queen thanks Dolittle and Stubbins for saving her.Dolittle returns to his sanctuary where he has officially taken Stubbins on as an apprentice, and he has decided to reopen the sanctuary to the public, as Lily would have wanted.During the closing credits, we see Mudfly still in the cave. He attempts to communicate with bats, only for them to swarm around him menacingly.\n",

Dana Randall Delta Goodrem is the pilot for the tiny Queensland company which aids people in the remote area, both for the people living there and for visiting tourists. Her dad Jeff Roy Billing chides her for blowing off highpaying visitors to transport a resident's dog who had been bitten by a snake and would die if it did not receive timely medical care to the vet, as their bills are mounting.William Mitchell Joshua Sasse is sent all the way from London by ITCM Financial, his father Duncan's Hugh Parker UK investment firm, to the tropics of Australia to shut down Fullerton Airways. He'd researched companies they have been backing, and pinpoints the small, flailing, familyrun seaplane business as ideal for liquidation as it lacks income. He's given a week to visit the company, go over their financial in person and return to the board meeting to shut them down, proving to his father he's ready to move up in the company.nDuncan says that if William does a good job, he will be made Junior Director at the company.Nikki Steph Tisdell, Fullerton's airplane mechanic, pushes Dana to find time to date but she insists she's too busy. Dana is dedicated to keeping Fullerton airways going as this was her dead mother's vision and wish.nThe next morning, Jeff warns them a rep from ITCM Financial is coming for an inspection. Dana is asked to pick up Will from the ferry, and initially they have a testy relationship. Jeff goes out of his way to try and impress William.nShe is quick to defend their remote air support, although Jeff tries to downplay it. William says that Government subsidizes the cost of fuel for the remote air support flights. But since Fullerton Airways has only one operational plane, it doesn't leave much room for profits.Dana whizzes Will around to a community off the coast of farnorth Queensland to deliver parcels to people in need, which she visits every two weeks as otherwise they'd be totally cut off. The plane is  years old, and William is claustrophobic.nAgain, they convince him to accompany her on her rounds a second day. This time the engine kicks out, but luckily Dana manages to keep her cool and lands the plane safely. She fixes the problem and the plane flies again.Afterwards, having drinks in Fullerton, Dana's ex Heath Simon Brook McLachlan sees her chemistry with Will and both he and Nikki encourage her to pursue him. So, they spend time together while crossing the tarmac, stargazing and sharing stories about their lives. Dana shares how much her family, and she are connected with the community. This is her purpose is life.A third day of helping Dana, and Will's father loses patience with him. William was supposed to have audited the financial by now, but he hadn't even started yet, as he was busy helping Dana.nWill tries to convince Duncan that they were wrong to want to write off the small aeronautical company, but Nikki overhears. Dana is chewing out over the news when confirmation of an impending cyclone reaches them.Will helps Dana find an injured Jeff, who'd been trying to help others seek safety against the cyclone. The threeperson staff of Fullerton Airways hole up with Will in the hangar's storage room to wait out the storm. He pledges to fight for their company at his headquarters, as he cares about Dana.The next morning, after the storm has passed, Will helps Dana deliver emergency supplies to many remote locations. Working hard all day, by nightfall she has made peace with him. However, as they're closing up the hanger for the night, Jeff announces that ITCM Financial has sent an email, shutting them down immediately.William has returned to London and has been unsuccessful in swaying the board. Dana arrives unannounced, armed with a plan to revamp and expand Fullerton Airways.
